# Hi!

This is meant to help people make AP worlds even if they have 0 experience programming. I tried my best to give a ton of explanation but I know its not perfect.
All of the explanations are kinda just me yapping so they could be unhelpful or super helpful, it all depends on the background of the person reading! I included a lot of explanations on basically every step including getting your fork and what the hell a github is.

The most important thing though is that you take this slow. Youre doing an AWESOME job just by downloading this to see if it helps you. And if it doesnt, thats fine!
Theres no pressure to get anything out in any time period.

The other most important thing is that this is only one of the resources you have available to you. Theres tons of AWESOME people in the archipelago discord that are primed to answer any question you have. Theres no bad questions whether this is the first time you have opened code or if you have been programming for years.
If you are worried about messaging in a large group chat then message me directly! My name is Nep (I have the profile pic of a cute rat). Im also super shy and awkward so Id love love love to help others that also feel that way.

# How do you make use of this?

Well theres a bunch of ways! To start though, you gotta first make a github account and fork the [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) project. Its above the big green Code button, sandwiched between the Watch and Star buttons. Name the repository whatever you want and make sure you make yourself the owner (Github is also really weird and you can only fork a project once on your account. There are work arounds though if you need). Now you want to open up your command terminal and navigate to where you want to place your project. Ill leave some helpful ways of using terminal at the bottom of this. Clone your repository (it will go into its own folder based on the name of the repository) and open it up in whatever you use to program! I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you hate AI like me, then dont worry you have to enable it in an extension.

Now that you have your cloned Archipelago project, go to the worlds folder and create a new folder for your game. Now you could manually create all the files and write everything yourself or just copy these files and drop them in. If it the file names are green that means they were newly added. Once you have the files in I would push your files up and make sure that its working and that you are able to commit everything. Again, Ill add some more specific details about what that means and how to do it at the bottom if you need it.

After that, youre good! You can start replacing all my unfunny comments with actually important stuff. Dont worry about "good" code or what it looks like. If it works, then its 10/10 no notes. Also dont be scared of errors! Run the generation as many times as you want. Errors are great cause they tell you what you need to fix or what to do next. They are great at guiding you. If you need help reading errors, then theres tons of people that can help you!

# Command Line/Terminal/Whatever

If you have multiple drives like a C and D drive that you can go to that drive just by putting the name of the drive followed by a colon into the terminal. It really is just that simple. When you want to move around then you use cd. As an example, if I wanted to go to my D drive and then go to a folder I created called workspace it would look this this.

>D:
>cd workspace

If you capitalized workspace then it needs to be capitalized when you cd into it as well. You can also use the TAB key to autocomplete file names. So instead of typing the entire word workspace you could just type `wor` and then hit tab and it will fix it for you. If you had more folder or file names that have that same `wor` starting condition then just keep hitting tab until you find it.
